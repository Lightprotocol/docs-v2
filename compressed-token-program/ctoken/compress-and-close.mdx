### CompressAndClose mode


The `Transfer2` instruction provides a `CompressAndClose` mode that compresses the full balance of a CToken account and closes it in a single transaction.

**Use when:** Optimizing storage and costs by moving tokens off-chain into compressed format while cleaning up the on-chain account.

**Key parameters:**

- `amount`: Full balance of the CToken account to compress
- `mode`: Set to `CompressionMode::CompressAndClose`
- `mint`: Index of the mint account
- `source_or_recipient`: Index of the source CToken account
- `authority`: Index of the owner/delegate account (must be signer)
- `pool_account_index`: Used as `rent_sponsor_index` for CompressAndClose
- `pool_index`: Used as `compressed_account_index` for CompressAndClose
- `bump`: Used as `destination_index` for CompressAndClose

**Example:**

```rust
use light_token_client::actions::compress_and_close::compress_and_close;

// Compress full balance and close account
compress_and_close(
    &mut rpc,
    ctoken_account_pubkey,
    compressed_account_index,
    &authority,
    &payer,
)
