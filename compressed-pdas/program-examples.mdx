## Airdrop Claim Reference Implementations

* **Basic**: [**simple-claim**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples-airdrop-implementations/simple-claim) - Distributes compressed tokens that get decompressed to SPL on claim.
* **Advanced**: [**merkle-distributor**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/distributor) - Distributes SPL tokens, uses compressed PDAs to track claims with linear vesting, partial claims, clawback and admin controls.

<Info>
For simple client side distribution visit [this example](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/example-token-distribution).

## Basic Operations

* [**basic-operations/anchor**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/basic-operations/anchor) - Anchor program with Rust and TypeScript tests
* [**basic-operations/native**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/basic-operations/native) - Native Solana program with `light-sdk` and Rust tests.

<Info>
Basic Operations include:
- **create** - Initialize a new compressed account
- **update** - Modify data of an existing compressed account
- **close** - Close a compressed account (it can be initialized again).
- **reinit** - Reinitialize a closed account
- **burn** - Permanently delete a compressed account (it cannot be initialized again).
</Info>

## Counter Program

Full compressed account lifecycle (create, increment, decrement, reset, close):

* [**counter/anchor**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/anchor) - Anchor program with Rust and TypeScript tests
* [**counter/native**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/native) - Native Solana program with `light-sdk` and Rust tests.
* [**counter/pinocchio**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/pinocchio) - Pinocchio program with `light-sdk-pinocchio` and Rust tests.

## Create-and-update Program

* [**create-and-update**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/create-and-update) - Create a new compressed account and update an existing compressed account with a single validity proof in one instruction.

## Create-and-read Program

* [**read-only**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/read-only) - Create a new compressed account and read it on-chain.

## Compare Programs with Solana and Compressed Accounts

* [**account-comparison**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/account-comparison) - Compare compressed vs regular Solana accounts.

## Nullifier Program

* [**nullifier-program**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/nullifier-program) - For some use cases, such as sending payments, you might want to prevent your onchain instruction from being executed more than once. Creates a rent-free PDA derived from an id. If the id has been used before, the PDA already exists, causing the instruction to fail.

## ZK-ID Program

* [**zk-id**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/zk-id) - A minimal Solana program that uses zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification with compressed accounts.
