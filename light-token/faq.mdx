#### What is light-token?

Light token is a high-performance token standard that is functionally equivalent to SPL, but stores mint and token accounts more efficiently. This reduces account creation cost while being more CU efficient than SPL on hot paths.

**Creation Cost**

|                   |      Light-Token |   SPL-Token |
| :---------------- | ---------------: | ----------: |
| **Mint Account**  | **0.00001 SOL** | 0.0015 SOL |
| **Token Account** | **0.00001 SOL** | 0.002 SOL |

**CU Performance**

|                          | Light-Token | SPL-Token |
| :----------------------- | ----------: | --------: |
| **ATA Creation**         |   **4,348** |    14,194 |
| **Transfer**             |     **312** |     4,645 |
| **Transfer** (rent-free) |   **1,885** |     4,645 |

#### Can I start using the Light Token Standard?

Yes! Light Token is deployed on devnet — start integrating today with our [Quickstart](/light-token/quickstart) and [Toolkits](/light-token/toolkits/overview).

For production on mainnet, use [Compressed Tokens V1](/compressed-tokens/overview), which are live and supported by leading wallets such as Phantom and Backpack.

#### Do I need to change my client code significantly?

No. The `light-token-sdk` methods are a superset of the SPL-token API.
Find examples below.

<CodeCompare
  firstCode={splCreateAtaCode}
  secondCode={lightCreateAtaCode}
  firstLabel="SPL"
  secondLabel="light-token"
/>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "15%" }}></th>
      <th>Light</th>
      <th>SPL</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Get/Create ATA**</td>
      <td>getOrCreateAtaInterface()</td>
      <td>getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Derive ATA**</td>
      <td>getAssociatedTokenAddressInterface()</td>
      <td>getAssociatedTokenAddress()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Transfer**</td>
      <td>transferInterface()</td>
      <td>transferChecked()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Get Balance**</td>
      <td>getAtaInterface()</td>
      <td>getAccount()</td>
    </tr>

#### Can light-token accounts hold SPL tokens?

Yes, light-token accounts can hold tokens from light, SPL, or Token 2022 mints.

SPL tokens can be transferred between SPL token accounts and light-token
accounts via the `transferInterface` method.

#### Do light-token accounts require rent?

The token standard pays rent-exemption cost for you. To prevent griefing, "rent" is paid over time to keep an account in memory. This is dealt with under the hood in a way that doesn't disrupt the UX of what your users are used to with SPL-token.

#### What happens if my light-token account runs out of rent?

The account is automatically compressed.
Your tokens are cryptographically preserved as a compressed token account (rent-free).
The account is loaded into hot account state in-flight when someone interacts with it again.

#### Does light-token support Token-2022 extensions?

Yes. The following extensions are supported:
- MetadataPointer
- TokenMetadata
- InterestBearingConfig
- GroupPointer
- GroupMemberPointer
- TokenGroup
- TokenGroupMember
- MintCloseAuthority
- PermanentDelegate
- Pausable
- TransferFeeConfig (Fees must be zero)
- ConfidentialTransferFeeConfig (Fees must be zero)
- TransferHook (`program_id` must be nil)
- ConfidentialTransferMint (Initialized but not enabled)
- ConfidentialMintBurn (Initialized but not enabled)
- DefaultAccountState (Any state allowed)

#### What is the difference between light-token and compressed token?

- **light-token** (Recommended): Solana account that holds token balances of light-mints, SPL or Token 22 mints. Highly CU efficient, ideal for DeFi and Payments. the token program pays the rent-exemption cost.
- **Compressed token** (Legacy): Compressed account storing token data. Rent-free, for storage and distribution.
