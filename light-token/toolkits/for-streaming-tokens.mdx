When a market becomes inactive, its token accounts and related PDAs will 
be compressed autoatically (cold storage). 
The state is cryptographically preserved on the Solana ledger.
While compressed, pure on-chain lookups will return uninitialized.

Your indexer should keep tracking, quoting, and routing markets even if the 
on-chain account shows `is_initialized: false`, `is_compressed: true`. 
To trade a cold market, the first client must prepend an 
idempotent decompress "warm up" instruction.
