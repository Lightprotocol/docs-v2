## What is ZK Compression?

ZK Compression is a framework that reduces the storage cost of Solana accounts by combining generalized state compression and <Tooltip tip="A cryptographic proof to verify the validity of a statement without revealing the underlying data. ZK Compression uses a Groth16 SNARK zk proof with a constant 128 bytes size">zero-knowledge proofs</Tooltip>.

<Steps>
  <Step title="State Compression">
   State compression stores account data on the Solana ledger instead of in millions of on-chain accounts. Only a small fingerprint of all accounts is stored on-chain for cryptographic integrity. Using Light Protocol, programs can use the account data inside Solana's virtual machine as if it were stored on-chain.

  </Step>
  <Step title="ZK">
    The protocol uses 128 byte zero-knowledge proofs (validity proofs) to verify the integrity of
    the compressed accounts. By default, this is all done under the hood. You can fetch validity
    proofs from RPC providers that support ZK Compression.
