## Rust Crates

ZK Compression's Rust crates are published to [crates.io](https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zk+compression) and can be found on [docs.rs](https://crates.io/search?q=zk%20compression) with the `light-` prefix.

- [`light-sdk`](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/sdk-libs/sdk) — For Anchor and native programs. Includes CPI utilities, compressed account abstractions similar to anchor Account, and metadata structs for CPIs to the Light System program.
- [`light-sdk-pinocchio`](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/sdk-libs/sdk-pinocchio) — For Pinocchio programs. Pinocchio-optimized SDK with compressed account abstractions and CPI utilities.

## Light Programs Overview

<Info>
Your custom program invokes the _Light system program_ via Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to leverage ZK Compression.
</Info>

| Program | Description |
|:-|:-|
| [light-system-program](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/programs/system) | Enforces compressed account layout, ownership checks, and validity proof verification. Used to create/write compressed accounts and PDAs. |
| [light-compressed-token](https://crates.io/crates/light-compressed-token) | SPL-compatible compressed token implementation with arbitrary compression/decompression support. |
| [account-compression](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/programs/account-compression) | State and address tree implementation used by the Light System program. Clients and custom programs do not interact with the Account Compression Program — this is handled under the hood. |
