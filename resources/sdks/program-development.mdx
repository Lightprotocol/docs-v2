## Rust Crates

ZK Compression's Rust crates are published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=light-) with the `light-` prefix.

| Crate | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| [light-sdk](https://docs.rs/light-sdk/latest/light_sdk/) | Core SDK for Anchor and native programs. Includes CPI utilities and compressed account abstractions. |
| [light-sdk-macros](https://docs.rs/light-sdk-macros/latest/light_sdk_macros/) | Procedural macros for Light accounts. |
| [light-sdk-pinocchio](https://docs.rs/light-sdk-pinocchio/latest/light_sdk_pinocchio/) | Pinocchio-optimized SDK with compressed account abstractions and CPI utilities. |
| [light-token](https://docs.rs/light-token/latest/light_token/) | CPI instructions for Light Token program. |
| [light-program-test](https://docs.rs/light-program-test/latest/light_program_test/) | Local testing framework for programs. |

## Light Programs Overview

<Info>
Your custom program invokes the _Light system program_ via Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to leverage ZK Compression.
</Info>

| Program | Description |
|:-|:-|
| [light-system-program](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/programs/system) | Enforces compressed account layout, ownership checks, and validity proof verification. Used to create/write compressed accounts and PDAs. |
| [light-compressed-token](https://crates.io/crates/light-compressed-token) | SPL-compatible compressed token implementation with arbitrary compression/decompression support. |
| [account-compression](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/programs/account-compression) | State and address tree implementation used by the Light System program. Clients and custom programs do not interact with the Account Compression Program — this is handled under the hood. |
