When a market becomes inactive, its token accounts and related PDAs will be compressed - their state is committed and effectively frozen until a client decompresses it.
While compressed, pure on-chain lookups will return uninitialized.

Your indexer should keep tracking, quoting, and routing markets even if the on-chain account shows `is_initialized: false`, `is_compressed: true`. To trade a cold market, the first client must prepend an idempotent decompress "warm up" instruction.

```rust
import { createLoadAtaInstructions } from "@lightprotocol/compressed-token/unified";

const warmupIxs = await createLoadAtaInstructions(
  rpc,
  tokenAccount,
  owner,
  mint,
  payer
);

new Transaction().add(...warmupIxs, tradeIx);
```
