1. The Light Token Program pays the rent-exemption cost for the account.
2. Transaction fee payers bump a virtual rent balance when writing to the account, which keeps the account "hot".
3. "Cold" accounts virtual rent balance below threshold (eg 24h without write bump) get auto-compressed. 
4. The cold account's state is cryptographically preserved on the Solana ledger.
   Users can load a cold account into hot state in-flight when using the account
   again.
