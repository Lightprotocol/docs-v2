<Accordion title="What is the difference between c-Mint, c-Token, and compressed token?">
- **c-Mint**: Compressed account representing a token (like SPL mint). Rent-free.
- **c-Token**: Solana account that holds token balances of c-mints, SPL or Token 22 mints. Uses sponsored rent.
- **Compressed token**: Compressed account storing token data. Rent-free, for storage and distribution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my c-Token account runs out of rent?">

Standard Solana RPC works for c-Token accounts (Solana accounts). Compressed token balances require the ZK Compression RPC.
