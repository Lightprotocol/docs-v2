1. cToken accounts hold token balances similar to SPL Token accounts.
2. cToken accounts are compressible, which means
    * the **rent-exemption** for the Solana account is **sponsored** by Light Protocol,
    * you pay <Tooltip tip="1 rent-epoch ≈ 1.5h ≈ 13,500 slots at 400ms per slot"> **rent per rent-epoch**</Tooltip> **instead** of the rent-exemption upfront,
    * accounts with <Tooltip tip="Rent for 260-byte cToken account per epoch: 360 lamports.">rent for less than 1 epoch</Tooltip> are compressed (360 lamports), and
    * compressed cToken accounts are decompressed with the same state when written to.

3. **Rent for 24h** (16 epochs) is **11,000 lamports** and paid at account creation.
4. Transactions to cToken accounts top-up rent, when the account's rent is below two epochs (766 lamports).
    * The top-up is configured to 766 lamports by default (rent for ~3h / 2 epochs).
    * Write transactions to compressed cToken accounts decompress the account.
5. The account creation and writes to decompress cost additional <Tooltip tip="Covers transaction cost to compress accounts (10,000) and protocol incentive (1,000). Transaction cost might vary.">11,000 lamports for compression & protocol incentive</Tooltip>.
