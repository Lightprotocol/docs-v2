| Example | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| [basic-operations/anchor](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/basic-operations/anchor) | Anchor programs to create, update, close, reinitialize and burn compressed accounts with Rust and TypeScript tests |
| [basic-operations/native](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/basic-operations/native) | Native Solana program implementation to create, update, close, reinitialize and burn compressed accounts with Rust tests |
| [Counter (Anchor)](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/anchor) | Full compressed account lifecycle (create, increment, decrement, reset, close) using Anchor framework |
| [Counter (Native)](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/native) | Native Solana program implementation with Rust tests |
| [Counter (Pinocchio)](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/counter/pinocchio) | Pinocchio implementation using light-sdk-pinocchio with Rust tests |
| [Create-and-Update](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/create-and-update) | Create new compressed accounts and update existing ones within a single instruction and one validity proof |
| [Read-Only](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/read-only) | Create compressed accounts and read them on-chain |
| [Account Comparison](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/account-comparison) | Compare compressed accounts with standard Solana accounts |
| [Nullifier Program](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/nullifier-program) | For some use cases, such as sending payments, you might want to prevent your onchain instruction from being executed more than once. Creates a rent-free PDA derived from an id. If the id has been used before, the PDA already exists, causing the instruction to fail |
| [ZK-ID](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/zk-id) | Program that uses zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification with compressed accounts |
