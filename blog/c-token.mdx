Today we introduce c-token, a new token standard on Solana.
The c-token program introduces two equivalents to SPL mints and tokens:

- c-mints with token metadata
- c-tokens 

We built the c-token standard to remove the well known barrier developers face on Solana to scale their application: the rent-exemption.

A key feature is that c-Token accounts can hold tokens from c-Mints, SPL mints, or Token 2022 mints.
This means you can convert existing SPL tokens to c-Tokens and back with a unified `transferInterface` method.
Existing SPL tokens can hereby benefit from the rent config c-token introduces.



Let's start by comparing it to SPL tokens


|  Creation Cost       | SPL               | c-Token            |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| **Mint Account**    | ~1,500,000 lamports        | **15,000** lamports     |
| **Token Account**    | ~2,000,000 lamports | **17,000** lamports |


### Why we built c-token
Rent is a well known barrier to developers to scale their application.

## c-Token SDK

The `c-token-sdk` follows similar patterns to SPL to maximize developer experience. 

<CodeCompare
  firstCode={`// Create SPL token account
const ix = createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
  payer,
  ata,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  secondCode={`// Create c-token account
const ix = CreateCTokenAccount.new(
  payer,
  account,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  firstLabel="SPL"
  secondLabel="c-Token"
/>

The token standard uses ZK Compression under the hood



## The Rent Model

c-Token accounts don't require upfront rent-exemption. Instead, rent is paid over time when accounts are accessed:

<CompressibleRentExplained />

<RentLifecycleVisualizer />

When rent runs out, the account is automatically compressed. Your tokens are preserved as a compressed token account (rent-free). The account decompresses automatically when you interact with it again.

## c-Token vs Compressed Tokens

A common point of confusion:

| | c-Token | Compressed Token |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Storage** | Solana account | Compressed account |
| **Rent** | Sponsored (pay-as-you-go) | None |
| **Use case** | Active wallets, trading | Distribution, storage |
| **RPC** | Standard Solana RPC | ZK Compression RPC |

Use c-Token for active token accounts. Use compressed tokens for distribution and long-term storage.
