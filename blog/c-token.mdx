 Today we bring to you c-token, a token standard equivalent to SPL mints and tokens but without rent-exemption:
- c-mints with token metadata, and 
- c-tokens.

The c-token program extends Solana's two main token programs (SPL and Token 2022).

At the moment around XXX token accounts are created on a daily basis.
Many are created and rarely accessed.
Still lock up SOL due to rent-exemption.
There have been many discussions around how to solve rent on Solana (SIMD references).
Compression denied due to developer experience.

That's why we built c-token
From now on, you can create mints and tokens 
1. at a fraction of the cost,
2. with improved performance,
3. similar developer experience.

#### Mints and Tokens at a Fraction of the Cost

|         | SPL               | c-Token            |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| **Mint Account**    | ~1,500,000 lamports        | **15,000** lamports     |
| **Token Account**    | ~2,000,000 lamports | **17,000** lamports |

#### Interoperability: Use C-Tokens with Existing SPL Tokens

A key feature to highlight is that c-token accounts can hold tokens from c-Mints, SPL mints, or Token 2022 mints.
This means you can convert existing SPL tokens to c-Tokens and back. 
Existing SPL tokens can hereby benefit from the rent config c-token introduces, to which we get in a minute.

This is implemented by the `c-token-sdk`.
It follows similar patterns to SPL to maximize developer experience. 
This makes it easy to integrate c-token in your protocol, app, or payment flow.

Example to create SPL vs c-token account:
<CodeCompare
  firstCode={`// Create SPL token account
const ix = createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
  payer,
  ata,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  secondCode={`// Create c-token account
const ix = CreateCTokenAccount.new(
  payer,
  account,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  firstLabel="SPL"
  secondLabel="c-Token"
/>

## Why we Built C-Token

We built the c-token standard to accelerate internet capital markets on Solana.

1. Launchpads launch x tokens daily on Solana. 
Few tokens are actively traded for more than 12h.
Most are created and merely active for 45 minutes.

2. More institutions are choosing Solana for their payments. 
Make Solana competitive with traditional finance.

## C-Token Program Features

### C-Mints with Metadata

C-mints uniquely represent a token on Solana and store its global metadata, similar to SPL mint accounts with few core differences:
- C-mint accounts are rent-free.
- Tokens created from c-mints are c-tokens.

- meme coins
. inactive
- lifecycle
- die out
- only active markets persist


Get in touch if your a launchpad that wants to integrate c-mints.

You can view the source code here.

### C-Token & Rent Model

C-tokens are like SPL tokens and hold token balances of c-mints, SPL mints, or Token 2022 mints.

C-token accounts don't require upfront rent-exemption. Instead, rent is paid over time when accounts are accessed:

<CompressibleRentExplained />

<RentLifecycleVisualizer />

When rent runs out, the account is automatically compressed. Your tokens are preserved as a compressed token account (rent-free). The account decompresses automatically when you interact with it again.

### C-Token vs Compressed Tokens

It's important to note c-token accounts are Solana accounts, not compressed token accounts. 
C-token simply uses ZK Compression under the hood to store inactive tokens.
You can still use compressed tokens for efficient token distribution.

| | C-Token | Compressed Token |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Storage** | Solana account | Compressed account |
| **Rent** | Pay-as-you-go | None |
| **RPC** | Standard Solana RPC | ZK Compression RPC |
