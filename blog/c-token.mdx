Today we introduce c-token, a new token standard on Solana.
The c-token program introduces two equivalents to SPL mints and tokens:

- c-mints with token metadata
- c-tokens 

We built the c-token standard to remove the well known barrier developers face on Solana to scale their application: the rent-exemption.

Both c-mints and c-tokens do not require the account creator to pay rent-exemption.

|  Creation Cost       | SPL               | c-Token            |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| **Mint Account**    | ~1,500,000 lamports        | **15,000** lamports     |
| **Token Account**    | ~2,000,000 lamports | **17,000** lamports |

### Use c-tokens with existing SPL tokens

A key feature to highlight is that c-token accounts can hold tokens from c-Mints, SPL mints, or Token 2022 mints.
This means you can convert existing SPL tokens to c-Tokens and back. 
Existing SPL tokens can hereby benefit from the rent config c-token introduces, which we get to in a minute.

This is implemented by the `c-token-sdk`.
It follows similar patterns to SPL to maximize developer experience. 
This makes it easy to integrate c-token in your protocol, app, or payment flow.

Example to create SPL vs c-token account:
<CodeCompare
  firstCode={`// Create SPL token account
const ix = createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
  payer,
  ata,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  secondCode={`// Create c-token account
const ix = CreateCTokenAccount.new(
  payer,
  account,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  firstLabel="SPL"
  secondLabel="c-Token"
/>

## C-Token Program Features

### C-Mints with Metadata

C-mints uniquely represent a token on Solana and store its global metadata, similar to SPL mint accounts with few core differences:
- C-mint accounts are rent-free.
- Tokens created from c-mints are c-tokens.

Get in touch if your a launchpad that wants to integrate c-mints.

You can view the source code here.

### C-Token & Rent Model

C-tokens are like SPL tokens and hold token balances of c-mints, SPL mints, or Token 2022 mints.

C-token accounts don't require upfront rent-exemption. Instead, rent is paid over time when accounts are accessed:

<CompressibleRentExplained />

<RentLifecycleVisualizer />

When rent runs out, the account is automatically compressed. Your tokens are preserved as a compressed token account (rent-free). The account decompresses automatically when you interact with it again.

### c-Token vs Compressed Tokens

It's important to note c-token accounts are Solana accounts. 
Under the hood, the c-token program uses ZK Compression.

| | C-Token | Compressed Token |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Storage** | Solana account | Compressed account |
| **Rent** | Pay-as-you-go | None |
| **RPC** | Standard Solana RPC | ZK Compression RPC |

Use c-Token for active token accounts. Use compressed tokens for distribution and long-term storage.
