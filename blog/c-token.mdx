title: "Announcing the Light Token Standard: Rent-free tokens on Solana"
description: " Today we bring to you the light-token standard. A token standard with mint and token accounts equivalent to SPL, but without rent-exemption."

At the moment around XXX token accounts are created on a daily basis.
Many are created and rarely accessed.
Still lock up SOL due to rent-exemption.
There have been many discussions around how to solve rent on Solana (SIMD references).

To truly scale Solana to 1 billion+ users the cost to store data must be near zero. 

That's why we built light-token, which is like SPL token just stored more efficiently to reduce account creation cost. 
Users receive and send the same tokens.
From now on, you can create mints and tokens 
1. at a fraction of the cost,
2. with improved performance, and
3. with similar developer experience.

#### Mints and Tokens without Rent-Exemption

| Creation Cost        | SPL               | Light            |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| **Mint Account**    | ~1,500,000 lamports        | **15,000** lamports     |
| **Token Account**    | ~2,000,000 lamports | ~**17,000** lamports |

#### Interoperability with Existing SPL Tokens

A key feature to highlight is that light-token accounts can hold tokens from light, SPL, or Token 2022 mints.
This means you can convert existing SPL tokens to light-tokens and back. 
Existing SPL tokens can hereby benefit from the rent config light-token introduces, to which we get in a minute.

This is implemented by the `light-token-sdk`.
It follows similar patterns to SPL to maximize developer experience
and puts the barrier low to integrate light-token in your protocol, app, or payment flow.

Example to create SPL vs light-token account:
<CodeCompare
  firstCode={`// Create SPL token account
const ix = createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
  payer,
  ata,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  secondCode={`// Create light-token account
const ix = CreateAssociatedTokenAccount.new(
  payer,
  account,
  owner,
  mint
);`}
  firstLabel="SPL"
  secondLabel="c-Token"
/>

## Light-Token Program Features

### Mint Accounts with Token Metadata

Mints uniquely represent a token on Solana and store its global metadata, 
similar to SPL mint accounts with few core differences:
- Light-token mint accounts are compressed accounts and rent-free.
- Tokens created from light-token mints are light-tokens.

You can view the source code here.

### Token Accounts with Pay-as-you-go Rent

Light-tokens are like SPL tokens and hold token balances of light, SPL, or Token 2022 mints.

Light-token accounts are Solana accounts, but don't require the creator to pay rent-exemption.
Instead, rent is paid over time when accounts are accessed:

<CompressibleRentExplained />

<RentLifecycleVisualizer />

The token accounts is initalized and funded with initial rent.
When rent runs low, transactions top-up the account's rent balance.
Transactions only top-up the account's rent balance, when it is low. 
When rent runs out, the account is automatically compressed. 
Your tokens are preserved as a compressed token account and 
are automatically decompressed when you interact with it again.
