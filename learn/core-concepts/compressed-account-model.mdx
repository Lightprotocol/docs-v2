# Overview

<Info>
  This guide assumes that you're familiar with [Solana's account
  model](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts).
</Info>

Compressed accounts store state and are similar to regular Solana accounts but with five main differences:

- Each compressed account can be identified by its hash
- Each write to a compressed account changes its hash
- An `address` can optionally be set as a permanent unique ID of the compressed account.
- All compressed accounts are stored in sparse state trees. Only the tree's state root (i.e., a small fingerprint of all compressed accounts) is stored in the on-chain account space.

These differences make compressed accounts rent-free and allow the protocol to store state as calldata on the Solana ledger instead of the costly on-chain account space.

# In a Nutshell

Transactions can use compressed account data inside Solana's virtual machine as if it were stored on-chain by combining state compression and zero-knowledge proofs:

1. Millions of compressed accounts are stored as hashes in Merkle tree leaves
2. All accounts stored in a Merkle tree are compressed into a single root hash
3. The root hash is stored in one Solana account for cryptographic verification
4. Compressed account state is recorded on the Solana ledger
5. The latest compressed account state is fetched from your RPC provider
6. Compressed account state is verified against the on-chain root hash with a validity proof

<Note>
- Merkle trees are provided by the protocol and Indexers generate validity proofs.
- Developers don't configure state Merkle trees or generate validity proofs.

[You will learn more about Merkle trees and validity proofs in the next section](/learn/core-concepts/merkle-trees-validity-proofs).

# Compressed Account Structure

Compressed accounts include the core Solana account fields (owner, lamports, data) plus additional fields to index and store compressed state.

# Address and Hash

Each compressed account can be **identified by its hash**, regardless of whether it has an address. By definition, whenever any data of a compressed account changes, its **hash changes**.

An **address** can serve as **optional** and additional **persistent identifier**.

- It's represented as 32 bytes in the format of a `PublicKey`.
- Addresses are optional, since ensuring that the address of a new account is unique incurs additional computational overhead.

<Tip>
Create an address wherever the state must be unique (such as for NFTs or certain PDAs) and requires a persistent identifier.

You don't need to create an address for fungible state (e.g., fungible tokens)

</Tip>

**Compressed Account Address Derivation**

Compressed account addresses are derived similar to PDAs.

- Like PDAs, compressed account addresses don't belong to a private key; rather, they're derived from the program that owns them.
- The key difference to regular PDAs is that compressed accounts require an **address tree** parameter.
- Address Merkle tree's store addresses of compressed accounts and ensure its uniqueness.

  &[
    b"seed_string",

);
```

# Data Field

The `data` field contains the compressed account's program state:

```rust
pub struct CompressedAccountData {
    pub discriminator: [u8; 8],  // Type identifier for account data
    pub data: Vec<u8>,           // Serialized program state
    pub data_hash: [u8; 32],     // Hash of the data field
}
```

- `discriminator`: Identifies the data type for programs to correctly deserialize account data. Similar to Anchor's 8-byte account discriminator.
- `data`: Stores the account's current state as arbitrary bytes (e.g., serialized user data, balances, metadata).
  - Compressed accounts have no fixed maximum size to store data like Solana's 10 MB.
  - Still, Solana's 1,232-byte transaction limit constrains practical data size to roughly 1 KB per account.
- `data_hash`: Hash of the `data` field (32 bytes).
  - When computing the compressed account hash for the state tree, the protocol uses this fixed-size hash instead of the variable-length data bytes.

# Compressed Token Account

Compressed token accounts store token balance, owner, and other information of token accounts (SPL, Token-2022, or Light).

1. Any Solana token account can be compressed/decompressed at will.
2. We recommend to use compressed tokens for token distribution.
