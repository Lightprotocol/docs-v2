1. Compressed tokens are compressed accounts with `TokenData` and rent-free.
2. Compressed token accounts store token balance, owner, and other information of tokens like SPL and c-Tokens. 
3. Any c-Token or SPL token can be compressed/decompressed at will.

## Recommended Usage of Compressed Tokens

  <Card title="">
  #### Storage of Inactive Token Accounts
  * Most (associated) token accounts are not frequently written to.
  * **Store token accounts rent-free** when inactive
  * [c-Tokens](/compressed-token-program/ctoken/README) are automatically compressed/decompressed, when active/inactive and include **sponsored rent-exemption**. [Learn more here](/compressed-token-program/ctoken/README).
  </Card>
  <Card title="">
  #### [Token Distribution](#advanced-guides)
    * Distribute tokens without paying up front rent per recipient.
    * Cost reduction for airdrops, payments, rewards, etc:

<Note>
Leading **wallets** like Phantom and Backpack **support compressed tokens**. The UI does not distinguish between SPL and compressed tokens.
