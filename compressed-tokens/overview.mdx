| Creation             | Regular SPL Token | Compressed Token      | Cost Reduction |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:----------------------|:---------------|
| 100 Token Accounts   | ~ 0.2 SOL         | **~ 0.00004 SOL**     | **5000x**      |

Compressed token accounts store information about an individual's ownership of a specific token (mint). Different from regular token accounts, they don't require an Associated Token Account (ATA) per token holder.

For example, this simplifies [token distribution](/compressed-tokens/advanced-guides/create-an-airdrop), since you don't need to allocate a token account per recipient.
